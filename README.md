Repo for my undergraduate thesis project: A Research on the Method of Automatic Curriculum Learning for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.

This is a method for better automatic curriculum learning for RL training environment design. If you are interested, please contact me to get the paper (Chinese only, because this is my undergraduate thesis LOL, but I would love to have a discussion about it if you want.).

Code largely based on [a previous research by Google](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/social_rl/).
